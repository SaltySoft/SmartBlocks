SmartBlocks
===========

This project aims to create an open source web app based CMS, that will allow you to create a suite of web apps.
Our primary goal is to simplify the creation of intranets or extranets.

SmartBlocks is made to be modular, thanks to its app blocks structure. You've got a kernel block, which is the
start for your suite, that contains basic apps, and you can plug as many blocks you want to it.

Each blocks contains PHP code for webservices on the back-end and JavaScript code, using Backbone.js for the front end
parts. The server handles data and external connections with PHP, the client handles interface with JavaScript.

We'll write more on the subject later. Please stay tuned :)
